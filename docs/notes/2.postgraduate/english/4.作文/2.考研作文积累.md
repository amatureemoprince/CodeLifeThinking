<div class="english-composition">

As is illustrated in the picture, the two disabled persons whose crippled legs are bound together do a lot of traveling.
Accordingly, this far-reaching picture reflects a common phenomenon in today's society: the people who are in the dark want
to turn the corner but they can not make it respectively and in turn they have to choose to pull together in times of trouble.

There are several reasons accounting for this. Since we have to live in an on-the-move lifestyle, we may encounter various
plights, where we would be at a loss rather than to seek for other's assistance. Furthermore, if we do not offer help to 
each other when we confront dilemma, we would not realize our dream. And no issue in China is as basic to build up the society
in harmony as to conduct coordination in face of disasters.

Judging from what have been argued above, people have come to realize the value of mutual aid. It is, therefore, necessary 
that some effective steps should be taken to advocate spirit of supporting each other. To begin with, the government should make
laws to encourage people to unite. In addition, people should enhance the awareness of caring each other especially when they are 
in trouble. Only in those ways can we make people even not being acquaintances help each other.
