Accordingly, this far-reaching picture reflects a common phenomenon in today&#39;s society: the people who are in the dark want to turn the corner but they can not make it respectively and in turn they have to choose to pull together in times of trouble.</p><p>There are several reasons accounting for this. Since we have to live in an on-the-move lifestyle, we may encounter various plights, where we would be at a loss rather than to seek for other&#39;s assistance. Furthermore, if we do not offer help to each other when we confront dilemma, we would not realize our dream. And no issue in China is as basic to build up the society in harmony as to conduct coordination in face of disasters.</p><p>Judging from what have been argued above, people have come to realize the value of mutual aid. It is, therefore, necessary that some effective steps should be taken to advocate spirit of supporting each other. To begin with, the government should make laws to encourage people to unite. In addition, people should enhance the awareness of caring each other especially when they are in trouble. Only in those ways can we make people even not being acquaintances help each other.</p></div><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">关联词汇</p><p><strong>合作</strong>：cooperation；teamwork；collaboration</p><p><strong>共赢</strong>：win-win；all win；win for all</p><p><strong>团队精神</strong>：team spirit；group spirit；community spirit</p><p><strong>团结友爱</strong>：solidarity and friendship；fraternal unity</p><p><strong>齐心协力</strong>：join hands (with)；make concerted effort；pool one&#39;s efforts together</p><p><strong>走南闯北</strong>：journey north and south</p><p><strong>发人深省</strong>：thought-provoking；provide much food for deep thought</p><p><strong>善待身边的人</strong>：show consideration for people around</p><p><strong>和谐社会</strong>：a harmonious society</p><p><strong>团结则存，分裂则亡</strong>：United we stand, divided we fall</p><p><strong>人心齐，泰山移</strong>：A people united can move mountains</p></div>',3)]))}const c=t(n,[["render",i]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/postgraduate/english/composition/postgraduate/","title":"考研作文积累","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"考研作文积累","createTime":"2025/07/12 19:02:20","permalink":"/postgraduate/english/composition/postgraduate/","icon":"streamline-freehand-color:composition-man","description":"2008年-Part B2008年-Part B As is illustrated in the picture, the two disabled persons whose crippled legs are bound together do a lot of traveling.
